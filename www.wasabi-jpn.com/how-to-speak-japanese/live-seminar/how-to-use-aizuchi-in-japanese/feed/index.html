		<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] This example may be a bit exaggerated, but this is an example of the Japanese way of constant active listening. Of course it’s not exclusive to the Japanese language, but more pronounced than for example in English. To someone who isn’t used to this type of constant active listening, these interjections may seem like someone is constantly interrupting you. But please don’t take it that way. It’s simply the Japanese way of showing you that they are actively listening to you and engaged in your story. You can learn more about Aizuchi here [&#8230;]]]></description>
